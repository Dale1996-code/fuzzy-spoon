Salesfloor dashboard.

## Local preview

From the repo root (where `index.html` lives), start a simple static server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser. Assets are referenced with relative paths so they work both locally and when served from `/fuzzy-spoon/` on GitHub Pages.
